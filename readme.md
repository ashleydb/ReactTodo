React To Do App

Add todo items, mark them as complete, toggle whether to show completed items and search through the list of todos. Uses local storage to keep your todo list between sessions.

v1.0 release is purely React code.
v2.0 release is using React with Redux.

(Note to self, need to set "heroku config:set NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false" to resolve a build error with yarn and node-sass)
